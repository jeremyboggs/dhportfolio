Hello! I'm Jeremy. I'm the Head of Research and Development for the [Scholars' Lab](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu), at the University of Virginia Library. My research interests include digital humanities, feminist interface design, and expressions of history/culture/identity in table-top role-playing games, particularly Dungeons & Dragons.
